# Loan-Approval-Prediction-

Here I put my new project in which I use finance dataset and predict loan approval.
In this project, I did brief analysis of data :
Handling Missing values and duplicates
Handling outliers and checking skewness and krutosis
Feature Engineering and EDA
And at last, I predict loan approval by using machine learning algorithms. I applied many models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, KNeighbors Classifier, XGBoost, Decision Tree Classifier and make their classification report, accuracy score and etc.
